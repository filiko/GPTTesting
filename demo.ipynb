      "### **Step 1: Define Your Target Function**\n",
      "- Decide what plant-supporting trait you want to enhance (e.g., phosphate solubilization, phytohormone production, nitrogen fixation, anti-pathogen activity).\n",
      "- **Example:** Boosting plant growth through phosphate solubilization.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Step 2: Source and Screen Native Actinomycetes**\n",
      "- Collect soil from healthy native plant sites in Texas.\n",
      "- Isolate actinomycetes using selective media (starch casein agar, glycerol asparagine agar).\n",
      "- Pick isolates that already have some ability to support plants (e.g., clear phosphate solubilization halos).\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Step 3: Planned Genetic Modification**\n",
      "- **Gene Selection:** Identify gene(s) that encode your trait of interest (e.g., *ppx* or *gcd* for phosphate solubilization).\n",
      "- **Plasmid Design:** Obtain or design a simple, broad-host-range vector with:\n",
      "    - Selectable marker (antibiotic resistance)\n",
      "    - Promoter functional in actinomycetes (ermE* or actII-ORF4)\n",
      "- Clone gene into plasmid, using affordable materials (DIY assembly, if needed—OpenWetWare has guides).\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Step 4: Transform Native Isolate**\n",
      "- Optimize a basic transformation protocol:\n",
      "    - Protoplast transformation (PEG-based)\n",
      "    - Electroporation—may require a cheap kit (or a university’s community lab resource)\n",
      "- Screen transformants using antibiotic plates.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Step 5: Confirm Gene Insertion and Expression**\n",

      "   - Minimum 5–10 pots per treatment (statistical significance).\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Procedure Overview:**  \n",
      "1. Prepare sterile pots with identical soil and seeds.\n",
      "2. Inoculate with equal CFU/ml of actinomycete strains or buffer.\n",
      "3. Water with sterile water, minimize contamination.\n",
      "4. Monitor and measure at 2-, 4-, 6-, and 8-week intervals:\n",
      "    - Germination %.\n",
      "    - Shoot/root length.\n",
      "    - Dry weight at endpoint.\n",
